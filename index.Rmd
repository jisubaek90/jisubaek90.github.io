👋🏽 Hello! My name is Jisu and I live in NYC now.<br>

🎓 Soon to be grad with a M.S. in Applied Analytics at Columbia University (May, 2022). Finished my B.B.A with an emphasis on Quantitative Methods at Sungkyunkwan University (Seoul, Korea).<br>

🔥 Aspire to become a leader and designer in data strategy, transformation, and growth to align to customer-centric focus in on/offline business.<br>

👗 Previously, worked as a Data Analyst - Sales and Marketing at Lotte Department Store where I automated the publishing of KPI reports using real-time Tableau dashboards.
